# El--final master program

The demonstration day is the graduation exhibition.
Timestamp on the right controls the height of El, to show people how daily accumulated power consumption is reflected on El.

Small mockups of house appliances were made with LEDs and a photoresister embeded in it. The fridge door could be opened, photoresister detects the door opening and lights up the LED inside the fridge. Buttons in front of the lamp and TV control their LEDs seperately. 
The appliance mockups simulate an authentic home envrionment, their on/off status resembles the situation of how current power consumption affects El's activeness.
